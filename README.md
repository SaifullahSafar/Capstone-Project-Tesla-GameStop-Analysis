# 📈 Capstone Project: Data Analysis & Visualization of Tesla and GameStop

## 🧩 Project Overview

This capstone project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The aim is to explore, analyze, and visualize stock and revenue data for **Tesla** and **GameStop**, two influential companies in the tech and retail sectors. Through this project, various data science tools and techniques are applied—from data wrangling and exploratory analysis to predictive modeling and interactive dashboards.

The final product is an end-to-end data science case study that demonstrates not only technical skills, but also the ability to derive business insights from real-world financial data.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

How can we use historical stock data and financial information to understand trends, compare business performance, and make basic predictive insights?

---

## 🧠 Key Tasks and Techniques

- ✅ **Data Collection**  
  Using `yfinance` and `BeautifulSoup` to gather historical stock prices and quarterly revenue data.

- ✅ **Data Cleaning & Wrangling**  
  Handling missing values, standardizing formats, parsing HTML tables, and preparing datasets for analysis.

- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Conducting in-depth EDA using `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Plotly`.

- ✅ **SQL-Based Data Queries**  
  Leveraging SQL to extract insights from structured datasets (e.g., SpaceX launch dataset).

- ✅ **Interactive Map Visualization**  
  Building a geospatial visualization with `Folium` to highlight relevant locations.

- ✅ **Predictive Modeling**  
  Applying classification models to predict business or landing outcomes.

- ✅ **Interactive Dashboard (Dash)**  
  Creating a fully interactive web-based dashboard using `Plotly Dash`.
